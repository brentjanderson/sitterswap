# SitterSwap.org Meteor Project

> Because everyone loves babies

Please update this document with details as needed.

## Getting Started
To get started with SitterSwap, you will need to get Meteor set up on your system.

### For Mac

    curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

### For Windows
This is more complicated. Meteor will run on Windows (and when deployed anyone can visit a Meteor site in a modern browser), but Meteorite - the community package manager - doesn't work properly on Windows. SitterSwap.org depends on Meteorite

To run Meteor with Meteorite on Windows, check out the instructions at http://win.meteor.com under "Virtualized Solutions". When finished, Meteor will run in a lightweight Linux VM but you will be able to edit and manage your project from Windows like it was running locally.
